			<h1>Side-By-Side Positioning Demo</h1>
			<div class="in-b">
				These two divs are positioned next to one another using <code>display: inline-block</code>
			</div>
			<div class="in-b">
				Notice the space between them.It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code
				organised.I've used reset to ensure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a
				bottommargin to make it easier to read) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be
				between two inline elements
			</div>

			<!-- === section part 2 === -->

			<div class="float-left">These two are positioned using <code>float: left.</code></div>
			<div class="float-left">You can see that,even though the elements are spacd in the code, the space is not actually
				rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples,but...</div>

			<br>

			<!-- === section part 3 === -->
			<div class="in-b width-50">What if I want my Side-By-Side elements to take up the full width of the parent element ?
				I can set the width of each to 50%, right?</div>
			<div class="in-b width-50">Wrong ! because, together the two inline block elements will add up to 100 % of the
				availabe width but that doesn't account for the space between.</div>
			<br>

			<!-- === section part 3 === -->
			<div class="float-left width-50">If I do the same thing with floated elements...</div>
			<div class="float-left width-50">The two elements are Side-By-Side just as I intended and fill the center width of
				the parent (which , in this case, is the same as the width of the viewport.)</div>
